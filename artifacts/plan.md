# Plan for Building the Web Page

## Overview

The web page consists of several distinct sections:

1. **Header**:
   - Positioned at the top of the page.
   - Contains the logo "jive" centered.
   - On the right side, there are "Login" and "Sign up" buttons.

2. **Main Hero Section**:
   - Below the header.
   - Contains a bold headline "Don't make connecting awkward".
   - A subheading with a brief description.
   - A prominent "Sign up free" button.
   - Background includes colorful, abstract shapes.

3. **Feature Section**:
   - Displays two overlapping smartphone images.
   - One phone shows a QR code, and the other shows a messaging interface.

4. **How It Works Section**:
   - Contains a heading "Here's how it works".
   - Three columns explaining the steps:
     1. Scan the QR code
     2. Send a message
     3. Follow-up from your inbox
   - Each column has an icon, a title, and a brief description.
   - A "Start Jiving" button below the columns.

5. **Footer**:
   - Contains the "jive" logo.
   - Links to "About", "Privacy", "Terms", and "Contact".
   - Copyright information.

### Layout Considerations

- **Flexbox vs. Grid**: 
  - Flexbox is recommended for the header, hero section, and footer for its simplicity in aligning items horizontally and vertically.
  - CSS Grid is recommended for the "How It Works" section to easily create the three-column layout.

- **Responsive Design**:
  - Ensure the layout is responsive, adjusting for different screen sizes.
  - Use media queries to adjust font sizes, button sizes, and layout for mobile devices.
